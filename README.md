# üí° Ordinal Theory

> Ordinal theory is is a protocol for assigning serial numbers to satoshis, the smallest subdivision of a bitcoin, and tracking those satoshis as they are spent by transactions.
>
> These serial numbers are large numbers, like this 804766073970493. Every satoshi, which is ¬π‚ÅÑ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ of a bitcoin, has an ordinal number.

Ordinals on BTC are a type of non-fungible token that is built on the Bitcoin blockchain and utilize the bitcoin nodes. They are called ‚ÄúOrdinals‚Äù because they are assigned a unique rank or position in a series of NFTs. This ranking system is what makes each NFT unique and distinguishes it from all other tokens within the series.

Each Ordinals is designed to be explored and analyzed exactly as you would on the Ethereum network. To make it easier for ETH users to access these NFTs, we plan to establish an Ordinals BTC launchpad that provides a streamlined and user-friendly interface for acquiring NFTs on the Bitcoin network.

In response to the growing interest in the Ordinals Theory, these NFTs aim to bring the benefits of NFTs to the Bitcoin network and provide a new way for users to interact with and own unique digital assets.
